                    <h3>Viro3D Joins the AlphaFold Database</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feb 2026:</strong> Our <a href="https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Viro3D</a> viral protein structure predictions have been incorporated into the <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EMBL-EBI AlphaFold Database</a> as a community dataset. The AlphaFold Database now hosts our collection of 85,000+ viral protein structure predictions spanning 4,400 human and animal viruses, making them accessible through the world’s leading protein structure resource. Read the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/updates-from-data-resources/alphafold-database-community-datasets/" target="_blank">EMBL-EBI announcement</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Launch of Viro3D Database</h3>
                    <p><strong>Oct 2025:</strong> We’re excited to announce the publication of "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44320-025-00147-9" target="_blank">Viro3D: a comprehensive database of virus protein structure predictions</a>". Using cutting-edge AI tools (AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold), we’ve predicted structures for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage of viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. This was a team-CVR collaboration with our colleagues Ulad Litvin, Spyros Lytras, Alexander Jack, David Robertson, and Joseph Hughes. We’ve made all these structures freely available through our new interactive resource: <a href="https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/</a></p>

                    <h3>AI & Pandemic Preparedness Roundtable</h3>
                    <p><strong>Aug 2025:</strong> Joe co-chaired a roundtable with UKHSA, bringing together experts from across government, academia, and public health to explore how biological AI can strengthen pandemic preparedness. Discussions centred on two themes: using machine learning for genomic surveillance and zoonotic risk assessment, and harnessing protein structure prediction tools to build libraries of therapeutic targets and vaccine antigens ahead of any future outbreak — a strategy of pre-emptive, knowledge stockpiling.</p>

                    <h3>New Publication on <em>Flaviviridae</em> Glycoproteins</h3>
                    <p><strong>Sept 2024:</strong> We’re pleased to share our new study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07899-8" target="_blank">Nature</a> which maps glycoprotein structures across the entire Flaviviridae family. By combining phylogenetic analyses with protein structure prediction, we’ve surveyed glycoproteins in this diverse virus family that includes important pathogens such as hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses. Our findings reveal class II fusion systems in most species, while highlighting structurally distinct E1E2 glycoproteins in hepaciviruses, pegiviruses and pestiviruses. This work, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Sydney, provides insights into viral fusion mechanisms and evolutionary history that have shaped the virology and ecology of these significant pathogens.</p>
